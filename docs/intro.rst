Introduction
============

Construct is a powerful **declarative** and **symmetrical** parser and builder for binary data.

Instead of writing *imperative code* to parse a piece of data, you declaratively define a *data structure* that describes your data. As this data structure is not code, you can use it in one direction to *parse* data into Pythonic objects, and in the other direction, to *build* objects into binary data.

The library provides both simple, atomic constructs (such as integers of various sizes), as well as composite ones which allow you form hierarchical and sequential structures of increasing complexity. Construct features **bit and byte granularity**, easy debugging and testing, an **easy-to-extend subclass system**, and lots of primitive constructs to make your work easier:

* Fields: raw bytes or numerical types
* Structs and Sequences: combine simpler constructs into more complex ones
* Bitwise: splitting bytes into bit-grained fields
* Adapters: change how data is represented
* Arrays/Ranges: duplicate constructs
* Meta-constructs: use the context (history) to compute the size of data
* If/Switch: branch the computational path based on the context
* On-demand (lazy) parsing: read and parse only the fields what you require
* Pointers: jump from here to there in the data stream
* Tunneling: prefix data with a byte count or compress it


Example
---------

A ``Struct`` is a collection of ordered, named fields::

    >>> format = Struct(
    ...     "signature" / Const(b"BMP"),
    ...     "width" / Int8ub,
    ...     "height" / Int8ub,
    ...     "pixels" / Array(this.width * this.height, Byte),
    ... )
    >>> format.build(dict(width=3,height=2,pixels=[7,8,9,11,12,13]))
    b'BMP\x03\x02\x07\x08\t\x0b\x0c\r'
    >>> format.parse(b'BMP\x03\x02\x07\x08\t\x0b\x0c\r')
    Container(signature=b'BMP')(width=3)(height=2)(pixels=[7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13])

A ``Sequence`` is a collection of ordered fields, and differs from ``Array`` and ``GreedyRange`` in that those two are homogenous::

    >>> format = Sequence(PascalString(Byte, "utf8"), GreedyRange(Byte))
    >>> format.build([u"lalaland", [255,1,2]])
    b'\nlalaland\xff\x01\x02'
    >>> format.parse(b"\x004361789432197")
    ['', [52, 51, 54, 49, 55, 56, 57, 52, 51, 50, 49, 57, 55]]


Construct has been used to parse:

* Networking formats like Ethernet, IP, ICMP, IGMP, TCP, UDP, DNS, DHCP
* Binary file formats like Bitmaps, PNG, GIF, EMF, WMF
* Executable binaries formats like ELF32, PE32
* Filesystem layouts like Ext2, Fat16, MBR

Development and support
-------------------------
Please use `github issues <https://github.com/construct/construct/issues>`_ to ask general questions, make feature requests (and vote for them), report issues and bugs, and to submit PRs. Feel free to request any changes that would support your project.

Main documentation is at `readthedocs <http://construct.readthedocs.org>`_, which is substantial. Source is at `github <https://github.com/construct/construct>`_. Releases are available at `pypi <https://pypi.org/project/construct/>`_.


Requirements
--------------
Construct should run on CPython 3.6 3.7 3.8 3.9 and PyPy implementations. PyPy achieves much better performance. Therefore PyPy would be somewhat recommended.

Following modules are needed only if you want to use certain features:

* Enum34 is optional if you want Enum EnumFlags to take labels from IntEnum IntFlag.
* Numpy is optional, if you want to serialize arrays using Numpy protocol. Otherwise arrays can still be serialized using PrefixedArray.
* Arrow is optional, if you want to use Timestamp class.
* Different Python versions support different compression modules (like gzip lzma), if you want to use Compressed class.
* Ruamel.yaml is optional, if you want to use KaitaiStruct (KSY) exporter.


Installing
-------------

The library is downloadable and installable from Pypi. Just use standard command-line. There are no hard dependencies, but if you would like to install all supported (not required) modules listed above, you can use the 2nd command-line form.

* pip install construct
* pip install construct[extras]


Type Hints / Type Annotations
---------------------------------

As an extension to this library there is the `construct-typing <https://pypi.org/project/construct-typing/>`_ library, which provides PEP 561 compliant stub files for this library. It also provides extended adapters to describe complex structures using PEP 526 type annotations for improved static code analysis with mypy.

* pip install construct-typing
