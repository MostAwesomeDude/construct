The Basics
==========


Fields
======

Fields are the most fundamental unit of construction: they **parse** (read data from the stream and return an object) and **build** (take an object and write it down onto a stream). There are many kinds of fields, each working with a different type of data (numeric, boolean, strings, etc.).

Some examples of parsing:

>>> from construct import Int16ub, Int16ul
>>> Int16ub.parse("\x01\x02")
258
>>> Int16ul.parse("\x01\x02")
513

Some examples of building:

>>> from construct import Int16ub, Int16sb
>>> Int16ub.build(31337)
'zi'
>>> Int16sb.build(-31337)
'\x86\x97'

Other fields like:

>>> Flag.parse(b"\x01")
True

>>> Enum(Byte, g=8, h=11).parse(b"\x08")
'g'
>>> Enum(Byte, g=8, h=11).build(11)
b'\x0b'

>>> Float32b.build(12.345)
b'AE\x85\x1f'
>>> Single.parse(_)
12.345000267028809


Variable-length fields
======================

>>> VarInt.build(1234567890)
b'\xd2\x85\xd8\xcc\x04'
>>> VarInt.sizeof()
construct.core.SizeofError: cannot calculate size

Fields are sometimes fixed size and some composites behave differently when they are composed of those. Keep that detail in mind. Classes that cannot determine size always raise SizeofError in response. There are few classes where same instance may return an int or raise SizeofError depending on circumstances. Array size depends on whether count of elements is constant (can be a context lambda) and subcon is constant size.

>>> Int16ub[2].sizeof()
4
>>> VarInt[1].sizeof()
construct.core.SizeofError: cannot calculate size


Structs
=======

For those of you familiar with C, Structs are very intuitive, but here's a short explanation for the larger audience. A Struct is a sequenced collection of fields or other components, that are parsed/built in that order. 

>>> format = Struct(
...     "signature" / Const(b"BMP"),
...     "width" / Int8ub,
...     "height" / Int8ub,
...     "pixels" / Array(this.width * this.height, Byte),
... )
>>> format.build(dict(width=3,height=2,pixels=[7,8,9,11,12,13]))
b'BMP\x03\x02\x07\x08\t\x0b\x0c\r'
>>> format.parse(b'BMP\x03\x02\x07\x08\t\x0b\x0c\r')
Container(signature=b'BMP')(width=3)(height=2)(pixels=[7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13])

Usually members are named but there are some classes that build from nothing and return nothing on parsing, so they have no need for a name (they can stay anonymous). Duplicated names within same struct can have unknown sideefffects.

>>> test = Struct(
...     Const(b"XYZ"),
...     Padding(2),
...     Pass,
...     Terminated,
... )
>>> test.build({})
b'XYZ\x00\x00'
>>> test.parse(_)
Container()

Note that this syntax works ONLY on python 3.6 and pypy due to unordered keyword arguments:

>>> Struct(a=Byte, b=Byte, c=Byte, d=Byte)


Containers
----------

What is that Container object, anyway? Well, a Container is a regular Python dictionary. It provides pretty-printing and accessing items as attributes as well as keys, and preserves insertion order in addition to the normal facilities of dictionaries. Let's see more of those:

>>> c = Struct("a"/Byte, "b"/Int16ul, "c"/Single)
>>> x = c.parse(b"\x07\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00\x01")
>>> x
Container(a=7)(b=256)(c=1.401298464324817e-45)
>>> x.b
256
>>> x["b"]
256
>>> print(x)
Container: 
    a = 7
    b = 256
    c = 1.401298464324817e-45

Thanks to blapid, containers can also be searched. Structs nested within Structs return containers within containers on parsing. One can search the entire "tree" of dicts for a particular name. Regular expressions are not supported.

>>> con = Container(Container(a=1,d=Container(a=2)))
>>> con.search("a")
1
>>> con.search_all("a")
[1, 2]


Building and parsing
--------------------

And here is how we build Structs and others:

>>> # Rebuilding and reparsing from returned...
>>> format = Byte[10]
>>> format.build([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0])
b'\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06\x07\x08\t\x00'
>>> format.parse(_)
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]
>>> format.build(_)
b'\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06\x07\x08\t\x00'

>>> # Mutate the parsed object and rebuild...
>>> st = Struct("num" / Int32ul)
>>> st.build(dict(num=7890))
b'\xd2\x1e\x00\x00'
>>> x = st.parse(_)
>>> x
Container(num=7890)
>>> x.num = 555
>>> st.build(x)
b'+\x02\x00\x00'

.. note::

   Building is fully duck-typed and can be done with any object.

>>> c = Struct("b"/Int32ul, "c"/Flag)
>>> class Dummy:
...     def __getitem__(self, key):
...             return 1
... 
>>> dummy = Dummy()
>>> c.build(dummy)
b'\x01\x00\x00\x00\x01'


Nesting and embedding
---------------------

Structs can be nested. Structs can contain other Structs, as well as any construct. Here's how it's done:

>>> st = Struct(
...     "inner" / Struct(
...             "data" / Bytes(4),
...     )
... )
>>> st.parse(b"lala")
Container(inner=Container(data=b'lala'))
>>> print(_)
Container: 
    inner = Container: 
        data = b'lala'

A Struct can be embedded into an enclosing Struct. This means all the fields of the embedded Struct will be merged into the fields of the enclosing Struct. This is useful when you want to split a big Struct into multiple parts, and then combine them all into one Struct. If names are duplicated, inner fields usually overtake the others.

>>> outer = Struct(
...     "data" / Byte,
...     "inner" / Embedded(Struct(
...             "data" / Bytes(4),
...     ))
... )
>>> outer.parse(b"01234")
Container(data=b'1234')

>>> outer = Struct(
...     "data" / Byte,
...     Embedded(st),
... )
>>> 
>>> outer.parse(b"01234")
Container(data=48)(inner=Container(data=b'1234'))

As you can see, Containers provide human-readable representations of the data, which is very important for large data structures.

Sequences
=========

Sequences are very similar to Structs, but operate with lists rather than containers. Sequences are less commonly used than Structs, but are very handy in certain situations. Since a list is returned in place of an attribute container, the names of the sub-constructs are not important. Two constructs with the same name will not override or replace each other.

Building and parsing
--------------------

>>> seq = Int16ub >> CString(encoding="utf8") >> GreedyBytes
>>> seq.parse(b"\x00\x80lalalaland\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00")
[128, 'lalalaland', b'\x00\x00\x00\x00']

Nesting and embedding
---------------------

Like Structs, Sequences are compatible with the Embedded wrapper. Embedding one Sequence into another causes a merge of the parsed lists of the two Sequences.

>>> nseq = Sequence(Byte, Byte, Sequence(Byte, Byte))
>>> nseq.parse(b"abcd")
[97, 98, [99, 100]]

>>> nseq = Sequence(Byte, Byte, Embedded(Sequence(Byte, Byte)))
>>> nseq.parse(b"abcd")
[97, 98, 99, 100]


Repeaters
=========

Repeaters, as their name suggests, repeat a given unit for a specified number of times. At this point, we'll only cover static repeaters where count is a constant int. Meta-repeaters take values at parse/build time from the context and they will be covered in the meta-constructs tutorial. Ranges differ from Sequences in that they are homogenous, they process elements of same kind. We have four kinds of repeaters. For those of you who wish to look under the hood, two of these repeaters are actually wrappers around Range.

Arrays have a fixed constant count of elements. Operator `[]` is used instead of calling the `Array` class.

>>> Byte[10].parse(b"1234567890")
[49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 48]
>>> Byte[10].build([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0])
b'\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06\x07\x08\t\x00'

Ranges are similar but they take a range (pun) of element counts. User can specify the minimum and maximum count.

>>> Byte[3:5].parse(b"1234")
[49, 50, 51, 52]
>>> Byte[3:5].parse(b"12")
construct.core.RangeError: expected 3 to 5, found 2
>>> Byte[3:5].build([1,2,3,4,5,6,7])
construct.core.RangeError: expected from 3 to 5 elements, found 7

GreedyRange is essentially a Range from 0 to infinity.

>>> Byte[:].parse(b"dsadhsaui")
[100, 115, 97, 100, 104, 115, 97, 117, 105]
>>> Byte[:].min
0
>>> Byte[:].max
9223372036854775807

RepeatUntil is different than the others. Each element is tested by a lambda predicate. The predicate signals when a given element is the terminal element. The repeater inserts all previous items along with the terminal one, and returns just the same.

>>> RepeatUntil(lambda obj,ctx: obj > 10, Byte).parse(b"\x01\x05\x08\xff\x01\x02\x03")
[1, 5, 8, 255]
>>> RepeatUntil(lambda obj,ctx: obj > 10, Byte).build(range(20))
b'\x00\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06\x07\x08\t\n\x0b'
